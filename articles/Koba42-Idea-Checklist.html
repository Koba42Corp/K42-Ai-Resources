Questions Every Founder Must Answer Before Building</h2>
<p><strong>Stop wasting money on development. Start here.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="section-1-the-problem">Section 1: The Problem</h2>
<p>Before you build anything, you need to prove the problem is real,
painful, and worth solving.</p>
<h3 id="what-specific-problem-does-your-product-solve">1. What specific
problem does your product solve?</h3>
<p>One problem. One sentence. If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t
understand it well enough.</p>
<p><strong>❌ Lazy:</strong> “It helps people be more productive”</p>
<p><strong>✅ Specific:</strong> “It eliminates the 3 hours per week
small business owners spend manually creating invoices”</p>
<h3 id="who-experiences-this-problem-most-painfully">2. Who experiences
this problem most painfully?</h3>
<p>Forget “everyone.” Who actually loses sleep over this? The more
specific you get, the easier everything else becomes—your marketing,
your messaging, your sales.</p>
<p><strong>❌ Impossible to market:</strong> A product for “busy
professionals”</p>
<p><strong>✅ Writes its own ads:</strong> A product for “solo
accountants drowning in client onboarding paperwork”</p>
<h3 id="how-are-they-currently-solving-this-problem">3. How are they
currently solving this problem?</h3>
<p>Every problem has an existing solution. Maybe it’s a competitor.
Maybe it’s a spreadsheet and prayer. Maybe it’s hiring an assistant.
Maybe it’s suffering in silence. You need to know what you’re replacing,
because that’s your real competition.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-the-current-solution-inadequate">4. Why is the current
solution inadequate?</h3>
<p>This is your opportunity. Is it too slow? Too expensive? Too
complicated? Too embarrassing to use? The gap between what exists and
what should exist is where your product lives.</p>
<h3 id="how-frequently-do-they-experience-this-problem">5. How
frequently do they experience this problem?</h3>
<p>Daily problems create habits. People will pay monthly for something
they use daily. Yearly problems need to be extremely painful to justify
a purchase. Frequency determines pricing power.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-emotional-cost-of-this-problem">6. What is the
emotional cost of this problem?</h3>
<p>People buy with emotion and justify with logic. Does this problem
make them feel stupid? Overwhelmed? Behind their competitors?
Embarrassed in front of their team? The emotional hook is often more
powerful than the practical one.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-financial-cost-of-this-problem">7. What is the
financial cost of this problem?</h3>
<p>Put a dollar amount on it. If you can show someone they’re losing
$1,000/month to this problem, charging $99/month is an obvious win. If
you can’t quantify the cost, you’ll struggle to justify any price.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="section-2-the-market">Section 2: The Market</h2>
<p>A real problem with no reachable market is just an interesting
observation.</p>
<h3 id="how-many-people-have-this-problem">8. How many people have this
problem?</h3>
<p>Actual research. Not guesses. Is your total addressable market 5,000
people or 5 million? This determines whether you’re building a lifestyle
business or a venture-scale company. Both are fine, but you need to know
which game you’re playing.</p>
<h3 id="can-these-people-afford-to-pay-for-a-solution">9. Can these
people afford to pay for a solution?</h3>
<p>Having a problem and having budget are different things. College
students have lots of problems. They have no money. Enterprise companies
have fewer problems but large budgets. Who are you actually targeting,
and what’s their purchasing power?</p>
<h3 id="where-do-these-people-congregate">10. Where do these people
congregate?</h3>
<p>You need to find them to sell to them. What subreddits? What LinkedIn
groups? What conferences? What podcasts do they listen to? What
newsletters do they read? If you can’t answer this, you can’t market
efficiently.</p>
<h3 id="are-they-actively-searching-for-solutions">11. Are they actively
searching for solutions?</h3>
<p>Check search volumes. Look at Google Trends. Are people typing this
problem into search bars? Active searchers are easier to convert than
people who don’t know they have a problem yet. Educating a market is
expensive.</p>
<h3
id="what-would-make-them-switch-from-their-current-solution-to-yours">12.
What would make them switch from their current solution to yours?</h3>
<p>Switching costs are real. Learning curves, data migration, team
retraining, breaking existing habits. Your product doesn’t just need to
be better—it needs to be enough better to justify the pain of
switching.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="section-3-the-value">Section 3: The Value</h2>
<p>If you can’t articulate your value clearly, neither can your
customers.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-dream-outcome-your-product-delivers">13. What is the
dream outcome your product delivers?</h3>
<p>Not features. Outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>❌ Features:</strong> “automated email sequences”</p>
<p><strong>✅ Outcomes:</strong> “more sales while I sleep”</p>
<p><strong>❌ Features:</strong> “project management software”</p>
<p><strong>✅ Outcomes:</strong> “projects that finish on time without
constant check-ins”</p>
<p>Sell the destination, not the vehicle.</p>
<h3 id="how-quickly-do-they-get-that-outcome">14. How quickly do they
get that outcome?</h3>
<p>Speed is a multiplier on value. “Get more clients” is okay. “Get your
first new client within 14 days” is compelling. The faster the result,
the more valuable the offer.</p>
<h3
id="how-likely-are-they-to-achieve-that-outcome-with-your-product">15.
How likely are they to achieve that outcome with your product?</h3>
<p>A program that works for 90% of users is worth more than one that
works for 30%. What can you do to increase their probability of success?
Onboarding? Support? Templates? Guarantees?</p>
<h3 id="what-effort-is-required-from-them-to-get-that-outcome">16. What
effort is required from them to get that outcome?</h3>
<p>Lower effort equals higher value. If they have to watch 40 hours of
training and completely change their workflow, that’s a hard sell. If
they can get results in 15 minutes, that’s an easy sell.</p>
<h3 id="can-you-articulate-your-value-equation">17. Can you articulate
your value equation?</h3>
<p><strong>Value = (Dream Outcome × Likelihood of Success) ÷ (Time to
Result × Effort Required)</strong></p>
<p>Your job is to maximize the top and minimize the bottom. Every
product decision should move this equation in the right direction.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="section-4-the-business-model">Section 4: The Business Model</h2>
<p>Ideas don’t pay bills. Business models do.</p>
<h3 id="how-will-you-make-money">18. How will you make money?</h3>
<p>Subscription? One-time purchase? Freemium? Transaction fees?
Usage-based pricing? Ads? Pick a model and understand its implications.
Subscriptions create predictable revenue but require ongoing value
delivery. One-time purchases mean constantly finding new customers.</p>
<h3 id="what-will-you-charge">19. What will you charge?</h3>
<p>Actual number. Not a range. “$47/month for the core plan, $147/month
for premium with additional features.” Vague pricing means you haven’t
done the thinking yet.</p>
<h3 id="why-will-people-pay-that-amount">20. Why will people pay that
amount?</h3>
<p>Connect price to value. If you charge $100 and they get $1,000 in
value, the sale makes itself. If the value isn’t obviously greater than
the price, you’ll fight for every customer.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-your-customer-acquisition-cost">21. What is your
customer acquisition cost?</h3>
<p>How much money to get one paying customer? Add up ads, content
creation time, sales calls, free trials that don’t convert—everything.
Most founders drastically underestimate this number.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-your-customer-lifetime-value">22. What is your customer
lifetime value?</h3>
<p>How much does the average customer pay over their entire relationship
with you?</p>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> Monthly price × average months retained =
LTV</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A $50/month product with 12-month average
retention has a $600 LTV.</p>
<h3 id="is-your-ltv-at-least-3x-your-cac">23. Is your LTV at least 3x
your CAC?</h3>
<p>This is the benchmark. If it costs you $100 to acquire a customer
worth $300, you have a healthy business. If it costs $100 to acquire a
customer worth $150, you’re in trouble. The math has to math.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-your-gross-margins">24. What are your gross
margins?</h3>
<p>Revenue minus direct costs, divided by revenue. Software typically
runs 70-85% margins. Services run 30-50%. Lower margins mean you need
higher volume to build a real business.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="section-5-the-competition">Section 5: The Competition</h2>
<p>If you think you have no competition, you haven’t looked hard
enough.</p>
<h3 id="who-are-your-direct-competitors">25. Who are your direct
competitors?</h3>
<p>Products that solve the same problem for the same people. Name them.
Use them. Understand them deeply. Ignorance of your competition isn’t a
strategy.</p>
<h3 id="who-are-your-indirect-competitors">26. Who are your indirect
competitors?</h3>
<p>This includes doing nothing, hiring someone to handle it, using
generic tools like spreadsheets, or any other way people currently
address the problem. These are often bigger competitors than the obvious
ones.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-competitors-do-well">27. What do competitors do
well?</h3>
<p>Be honest. Where are they winning? What do their customers love?
Understanding their strengths helps you avoid competing where you’ll
lose.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-competitors-do-poorly">28. What do competitors do
poorly?</h3>
<p>Read their one-star reviews. What complaints come up repeatedly?
Where are customers frustrated? These gaps are your opportunities.</p>
<h3 id="why-will-customers-choose-you-over-them">29. Why will customers
choose you over them?</h3>
<p>Not “because we’re better.” Specifically, what do you offer that they
can’t or won’t? Lower price? Better experience? Specific niche focus?
Faster results? You need a clear differentiator.</p>
<h3 id="whats-your-unfair-advantage">30. What’s your unfair
advantage?</h3>
<p>What do you have that’s hard to replicate? Domain expertise from 10
years in the industry? Proprietary technology? Existing audience? Key
relationships? Strategic partnerships? If there’s no moat, you’re
building on borrowed time.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="section-6-the-product">Section 6: The Product</h2>
<p>Features are easy to list. The right features are hard to choose.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-minimum-viable-product">31. What is the minimum
viable product?</h3>
<p>The smallest version that delivers the core value proposition. Not
your full vision—your starting point. Most founders include too much in
“minimum.” Cut deeper.</p>
<h3 id="what-features-are-essential-for-launch">32. What features are
essential for launch?</h3>
<p>List them. Then ask yourself: “Would someone pay for this without
that feature?” If yes, cut the feature. Repeat until you’re
uncomfortable. That’s your launch scope.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-the-user-journey-look-like">33. What does the user
journey look like?</h3>
<p>Map every step. How do they discover you? What makes them sign up?
What happens in their first session? How do they reach the “aha moment”?
What brings them back? Where might they drop off?</p>
<h3 id="what-technical-requirements-do-you-have">34. What technical
requirements do you have?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> web, iOS, Android?</li>
<li><strong>Integrations:</strong> what other tools must you connect
with?</li>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> how fast does it need to be?</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> what data are you handling and what
compliance matters?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-is-your-realistic-development-timeline">35. What is your
realistic development timeline?</h3>
<p>Whatever you think, double it. Then add 50%. Software always takes
longer than expected. Plan for delays so they don’t destroy your
runway.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-your-realistic-development-budget">36. What is your
realistic development budget?</h3>
<p>Get actual quotes from actual developers. Add 30% contingency.
Underfunding is the most common startup killer. Know your real
numbers.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="section-7-the-reality-check">Section 7: The Reality Check</h2>
<p>Optimism builds companies. Delusion kills them.</p>
<h3 id="why-will-this-succeed-when-similar-ideas-have-failed">37. Why
will this succeed when similar ideas have failed?</h3>
<p>Others have tried something similar. They probably failed. Do you
know why? What’s different about your timing, approach, market, or
execution?</p>
<h3 id="whats-the-biggest-risk-to-this-business">38. What’s the biggest
risk to this business?</h3>
<p>Be honest. Is it that the market doesn’t exist? That a big player
could crush you? That the technology is too hard? That you’ll run out of
money? Name your biggest threat.</p>
<h3 id="how-will-you-mitigate-that-risk">39. How will you mitigate that
risk?</h3>
<p>Knowing the risk isn’t enough. What’s your plan? If market risk is
highest, validate more before building. If competition risk is highest,
build faster or find a defensible niche.</p>
<h3 id="why-are-you-the-right-person-to-build-this">40. Why are you the
right person to build this?</h3>
<p>Domain expertise? Technical skills? Existing relationships with
target customers? Previous startup experience? Not everyone should build
every idea. Why this idea for you?</p>
<h3 id="can-you-survive-18-months-without-revenue">41. Can you survive
18 months without revenue?</h3>
<p>Most products take longer to reach profitability than founders
expect. What’s your runway? Can you extend it? Do you need outside
funding, and if so, when?</p>
<h3
id="are-you-building-this-because-the-market-needs-it-or-because-you-want-to-build-it">42.
Are you building this because the market needs it, or because you want
to build it?</h3>
<p>Honest answer only. Passion projects can become businesses, but only
if the market agrees. Are you solving your own problem or a real market
need? Markets don’t care about your passion. They care about their
problems.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-happens-next">What Happens Next</h2>
<p>Answering these questions is step one.</p>
<p><strong>Step two is turning your answers into action:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Validate with real customers.</strong> Talk to at least
10 people who fit your target profile. Don’t pitch. Listen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Build your documentation.</strong> Executive summary,
market analysis, product requirements, financial model. One document
that captures everything.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Run the numbers.</strong> If the math doesn’t work on
paper, it won’t work in reality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Then—and only then—find a developer.</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>You’ll show up prepared. You’ll earn respect. You’ll get better work
at better rates.</p>
<p>And you’ll have done what 90% of aspiring founders never do: the real
work before the build begins.</p>
<p><strong>Your idea might change the world. Prove it here
first.</strong></p>
